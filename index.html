<h2>Meng Yu</h2> 


<p>I'm a Principle Research Scientist at <a href="https://ai.tencent.com/ailab/" target="_blank">Tencent AI Lab</a> since 2016. From 2013 to 2016, I worked as a staff research engineer on audio/speech enhancement for voice communication and improved speech recognition in Audience (a Knowles Company). I was a software engineer working on speaker segmentation and recognition in Cisco from 2012 to 2013. I received my B.S. in Mathematics from Peking University, Beijing, China in 2007, 
and a Ph.D. degree in Mathematics from University of California, Irvine, CA, USA in 2012. </p>

<p>My research interests are in audio/speech processing and related fields, particularly in single and multi-channel speech enhancement, 
dereverberation, echo cancellation and other far field frontend speech enhancement applications; 
deep learning based speech enhancement and separation (cocktail party problem); 
and their joint optimization with keyword spotting and acoustic model of speech recognition. </p>
