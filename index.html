<h2>Meng Yu</h2> 


<p>I'm a Principle Research Scientist at <a href="https://ai.tencent.com/ailab/" target="_blank">Tencent AI Lab</a> since 2016. From 2013 to 2016, I worked as a staff research engineer on audio/speech enhancement for voice communication and improved speech recognition in Audience (a Knowles Company). I was a software engineer working on speaker segmentation and recognition in Cisco from 2012 to 2013. I received my B.S. in Mathematics from Peking University, Beijing, China in 2007, 
and a Ph.D. degree in Mathematics from University of California, Irvine, CA, USA in 2012. </p>

<p>My research interests are in audio/speech processing and related fields, particularly in single and multi-channel speech enhancement, 
dereverberation, echo cancellation and other far field frontend speech enhancement applications; 
deep learning based speech enhancement and separation (cocktail party problem); 
and their joint optimization with keyword spotting and acoustic modeling of speech recognition. </p>

<p>I serve as a reviewer for ICASSP, Interspeech, IEEE Workshop on Application of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics (WASPAA), 
IEEE Digital Signal Processing Workshop, IEEE /ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing, 
EURASIP Journal on Audio, Speech, and Music Processing, Journal of Computer Science and Technology, ACM Multimedia, Speech communication, Communications in Mathematical Sciences, etc.
